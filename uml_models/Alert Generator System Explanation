The Alert Generator System UML diagram is intended to present the system in a simple manner. Redundant information, such as setters and getters for private classes, has been omitted for clarity. Therefore, providing a comprehensive understanding of how the system operates without delving into the technical details of the actual implementation.

The AlertGenerator system primarily focuses on three classes: AlertGenerator, Alert, and AlertManager. The AlertGenerator class communicates with external systems such as Patient Identification to match the alert to the patient and the Data Storage System to obtain Patient Data. By querying the Data Storage system, the AlertGenerator class might trigger an alert. This is accomplished through the triggerAlert method, which instantiates an object of the Alert class with all the attributes specified in the diagram. Subsequently, this Alert is added to the Alert Manager Class, which is responsible for sending the alert to medical staff.
