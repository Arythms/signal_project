The Patient Identification System UML Diagram comprises three main classes: the Patient Identifier, Identity Manager, and the Patient Record. Within this system, the Patient Identifier class plays a crucial role, interacting with the PatientRecord Class via the getPatientRecord method. Additionally, it is responsible for matching patient IDs and collaborating with the Identity Manager class through the matchPatientID method, which cross-references patient IDs. The Identity Manager class holds the responsibility of managing anomalies that may arise during the patient ID matching process. The design of the UML diagram is made to be as simple as possible to represent the interaction within classes without overwhelming the viewer of the diagram too much so it is simple to understand and doesnâ€™t require much effort.

Furthermore, the Patient Identifier class extends its functionality by interacting with both the data storage system and the alert generation system. Through these interactions, it aids in identifying patients within the system and assists in pinpointing the relevant patient when generating alerts. These systems are represented in the UML diagram with two boxes that represents the models they indicate.
