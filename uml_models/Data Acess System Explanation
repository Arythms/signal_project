The aim of the data access system UML diagram is to provide a simplified representation for understanding the overall functioning of the system without unnecessary complication. The system is connected to the Data Storage System through the Data Source Adapter class, which is not explicitly indicated on the diagram since it could be a bit redundant. However adding the reminder that this interacts with the Data Storage System might allow a more clear view of the interaction between the different systems.

The Data Listener is an abstract class responsible for generating other instances of data listening classes, such as the TCPDataListener class, WebsocketDataListener class, and FileDataListener class. However, additional classes could be created to adapt to different methods of obtaining data. The data listener classes interact with the DataParser class, which is capable of parsing data into a understandable format from the listener. This interaction is represented with a direct association arrow, as without one, the other wouldn't exist in the system. Similarly, the Data Parser class interacts with the Data Source Adapter, which finalizes the processing of listening to patient input.
