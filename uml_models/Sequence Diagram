The design of the UML Sequence Diagram of the AlertGeneration  System highlights the  interaction between the Main Classes of the Alert Generation System in order. Firstly we represent two actors of the system : the nurse and the patient. Secondly we represent the classes AlertMonitor, AlertGenerator, Alert and Data Storage.  These classes interact with each other  sending each other messagues represented with an arrow. The class "Alert" is represented in a lighter color to represent an instance of the class Alert that is generated.

The diagram represents the following: Firstly Patient data is being checked by the Alert Monitor or Patient Condition checker. This class sends a messague to the Alert Generator if the threshold is surprassed. This class then sends a messague to the Data Storage Class that retrieves data and checks if it's continuing or not. Here the diagram has two possible outcomes. If the Alert is continuing or not. If it is not continuing the class Data Storage replies to the Alert Generator Class by not confirming the Alert. If its continuing then it replies confirming the Alert. Then the Alert Generator class instanciates a new object of the class Alert and sends a messague to the medical Staff. The alert sent to the Medical Staff  and this is  acknolodged by treating the patient . After the acknoldgement the alert is resolved and the instance of the Alert class is deleted.
