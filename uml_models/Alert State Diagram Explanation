The design choices in the alert generation State Diagram aim to provide a clear and straightforward representation of the alert lifecycle. The initial state circle signifies the alert's inactive state, while the "generated" state marks the beginning of the alert's lifecycle when triggered. Transitions between states, including "sent," "acknowledged," and "resolved," depict the progression of the alert through different stages. The use of two distinct arrows from the "acknowledged" state to the "resolved" state clarifies the two methods of resolving an alert. Additionally, including an arrow back to the "idle" state from the "resolved" state indicates the completion of the alert's lifecycle. These design choices prioritize simplicity and clarity, enabling viewers to easily comprehend the alert generation process.

Other possible way of drawing the UML diagram would have been not to include the Idle state and just begin the State diagram with the initial state and end with the final state circle. However I thought it would be more comprehensive to include the idle state to represent that there might not be a Alert generated if a threshold is not surpassed but the system still exists.
