The Data Storage UML Diagram depicts  how the Data Storage System operates in a straightforward manner, highlighting the most importantt methods to comprehend the relationships between classes.

First off, the DataStorage class contains a HashMap named data that maps patient IDs to instances of the PatientData class. This is depicted not with an arrow, but with a line with a composition arrow to signify the dynamic nature of the data storage as a repository for these instances. While the PatientData constructor in the diagram is simplified for visual clarity, it is intended to be constructed with attributes. Retrieving data in the Data Storage class is kept private to safeguard user privacy. If data retrieval is necessary, it is accomplished using the DataRetriever class, which is dependent on the DataStorage class, as it wouldn't exist otherwise. This class is solely responsible for fetching the data but relies on the Identity Manager class to authorize users and determine if the requester is permitted to access the data. Additionally, I've included methods in this class to manage the staff authorized to access the data.
